## Introduction
- Our solution provides the dealer with valuable information about vehicles available in inventory and is designed as a tool for the dealer to use when consulting with a potential customer.
- The dealer will add vehicles to inventory by **uploading a spreadsheet** with VIN and pertaining information.
- Data and image of vehicle is pulled from online sources and presented in its own landing page.

## Features
- Dealer **logins** to access the application. This ensures an unauthorized third party cannot access inventory information. 
- **Easy-to-use** interface to view inventory. 
- Quickly **filter and sort** vehicles based on feature interest (**safety features, vehicle type, fuel source**). 
- View **detailed specs**, **sales information**, and **pictures** of each vehicle. 
- Easily **upload a spreadsheet** to batch add to inventory (designed to work well with dealer’s **existing workflows**). 
- Remove from inventory based on **sales status** or via **spreadsheet**.

## Purpose and Business Outcomes 
- Dealers may carry **hundreds of vehicles** of different makes and models. 
- Our inventory management solution targets small car dealers that only uses an **Excel spreadsheet or basic database software** (Microsoft Access) to manage their inventory.
- Solution streamlines a car dealer’s workflow, allowing them to focus on things **other than mundane inventory management**.
- [**According to Consumer Reports:**](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/car-safety-survey-new-car-buyers-want-advanced-safety-not-automation/) “In a national survey of U.S. drivers planning on buying a new or used vehicle in the next two years, 51 percent said it was important that their next car have a rearview camera or backup warning, and 45 percent said they wanted a blind-spot warning system.”
- Our solution allows the dealer to **quickly understand** which vehicles in their inventory have these safety features and meet this crucial **consumer need**.
